# WPF_Memory_Games
This is my first C# self-project that aim to help junior Information Engineering students to know how their professors look like in CUHK by using a game! This application is built on the WPF framework with the OOP C# language that I learnt within 2 months. Please feel free do download and try to have some fun on it!

 - Please download the file releaseWPFgame_IERG.exe to start the game!
